"""Unit tests for GovernedPolicyExecutor Pipeline (Task 2).

Validates:
1. ALLOW policy decision generates and emits a signed execution token.
2. Tampered evidence payload fails closed with zero tokens emitted.
3. Replay attack with previously consumed retrieval_id is rejected immediately.
4. Missing retrieval_id fails closed before verification.
5. Policy DENY decision fails closed with zero tokens emitted and rejection reason.
6. Policy REQUIRES_APPROVAL decision fails closed with zero tokens emitted.
7. Expired evidence package timestamp fails closed before plan execution.
